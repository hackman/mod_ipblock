This module aims to provide protection from aggressive clients 
by blocking or reporting them with a script.

You will be able to add a limit of simmultaneous connections. 
When this limit is reached the module will execute the defined 
command.

You can then write a simple bash script that can run commands 
with sudo(8) in order to limit the client or notify the admins.

The module provides two options:
  IPBlockLimit - the number of simmultaneous connections on 
	which the module will execute the command defined by IPBlockCmd
  IPBlockCmd - the command that will be executed when the limit 
	is reached

The script receives the following arguments:
 $1 - the offending IP address
 $2 - the number of simmultaneous connections
 $3 - the limit set in the httpd.conf
 $4 - the last URL that was accessed

Example configuration:

<IfModule mod_ipblock.c>
	IPBlockLimit 1000
	IPBlockCmd "/usr/local/bin/block"
</IfModule>

Here is an example of the arguments that the script receives:
 127.0.0.1 3 2 gamelon/resources/css/visual
